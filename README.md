Steps we would need to follow as we create this calculator?

1. An HTML Form template to just show the:
	a. Numbers
	b. Signs (+, _, /, *)
	c. Submit button 
	d. Answer Space
2.  We will have to php codes that accepts out datas from this template
3. Create an object called "calculation", which would have function add, minus, multiply and divide
4. We would make sure our functions are called/used so we can get adequate answers.
